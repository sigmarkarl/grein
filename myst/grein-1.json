This task translates to a Spark map/reduce process that uses NCBI blast or diamond (with a blast compatible output) to join homolog genes. A blast/diamond protein database with all the genes in the project is created. A Spark dataset of protein fasta entries is generated for each gene. The unique gene id from the genbank files is used to identify the genes. By default, each species or a contig is a single partition in the Spark gene dataset but the user can change the number of partitions depending on the size of the data and compute cluster. The default criteria for joining two genes is the 50/50 rule. That means, at least 50% of the gene length must have 50% identity with the comparing sequence. For metagenomic analysis or viral genomes a less stringent values might be suitable, such as 25/50. A map step on the gene spark datasets maps each fasta entry to a group of gene ids from the blast/diamond run. The final reduce step joins all the groups that have common entries. The result is saved into the project zip file as a text file containing comma separated list of all gene ids in a group per line. This step is computationally expensive compared to other clustering approaches in pan genomes, such as MCL. Doing an all against all blast is much more accurate though and within the scope of bacterial analysis, especially when using cloud computing environments such as Apache Spark.","key":"m2KY4G4mT7"}],"key":"tDHPAkE9Xo"},{"type":"heading","position":{"start":{"offset":8144,"line":67,"column":1},"end":{"offset":8154,"line":67,"column":11}},"depth":5,"children":[{"type":"text","position":{"start":{"offset":8155,"line":67,"column":12},"end":{"offset":8158,"line":67,"column":15}},"value":"MSA","key":"omluRyoyxe"}],"label":"MSA","identifier":"msa","html_id":"msa","key":"uzFV6Fd8j6"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"offset":8172,"line":69,"column":1},"end":{"offset":8175,"line":69,"column":4}},"children":[{"type":"text","position":{"start":{"offset":8172,"line":69,"column":1},"end":{"offset":8175,"line":69,"column":4}},"value":"The main Geneset table has now been reduced (from around 200000 gene entries to 8500 gene families in a project using 100 Thermus strains).

In the case of our example Thermus project the 8500 gene groups are reduced to around 7000 synteny islands. As such, the majority of the genes in a 100 strain project have fluctuating synteny. A few islands of essential genes have conserved gene order, largest of them being the 30S/50S gene island. Each island object is marked with the number of motifs of each type. This can be helpful when locating errors or specific behavior in the genome. Motif A for instance indicates an insert of gene of genes. Motif B might indicate a sequencing error where a contig is cut short and a gene doesn’t fall into its correct group, hence the split. In that case, the edge weight is low, preferably 1 strain. Otherwise motif B can show where a different family of genes are spliced into the same location in different species. Motif C is where genes or islands have swapped places in the genome order. No instance of the C motif was found in our Thermus project so it might not be a common event.
