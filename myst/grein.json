This task translates to a Spark map/reduce process that uses NCBI blast or diamond (with a blast compatible output) to join homolog genes. A blast/diamond protein database with all the genes in the project is created. A Spark dataset of protein fasta entries is generated for each gene. The unique gene id from the genbank files is used to identify the genes. By default, each species or a contig is a single partition in the Spark gene dataset but the user can change the number of partitions depending on the size of the data and compute cluster. The default criteria for joining two genes is the 50/50 rule. That means, at least 50% of the gene length must have 50% identity with the comparing sequence. For metagenomic analysis or viral genomes a less stringent values might be suitable, such as 25/50. A map step on the gene spark datasets maps each fasta entry to a group of gene ids from the blast/diamond run. The final reduce step joins all the groups that have common entries. The result is saved into the project zip file as a text file containing comma separated list of all gene ids in a group per line. This step is computationally expensive compared to other clustering approaches in pan genomes, such as MCL. Doing an all against all blast is much more accurate though and within the scope of bacterial analysis, especially when using cloud computing environments such as Apache Spark.","key":"LNyhQRu5ZE"}],"key":"Qz4AImjXP5"},{"type":"heading","depth":4,"position":{"start":{"line":51,"column":0},"end":{"line":52,"column":0}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"MSA","key":"h4Dzbj6K8T"}],"identifier":"msa","label":"MSA","html_id":"msa","implicit":true,"key":"BP5D0lYPcz"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":52,"column":0},"end":{"line":53,"column":0}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The main Geneset table has now been reduced (from around 200000 gene entries to 8500 gene families in a project using 100 Thermus strains).
